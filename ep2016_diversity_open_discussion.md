# Open Discussion About Diversity in Our Community – Held in EuroPython 2016

\* The following is not a protocol of the meeting and does not necessarily sum up everything that was discussed. It does contain many of the points that were raised, both general thoughts and concepts regarding diversity in the community as well as practical suggestions for future events and interactions.
One of the aims of this open discussion was to keep the issue of diversity in the awareness of the community and as an ongoing concern, and we encourage the continuation of the discussion here and in all other platforms.

### What is Diversity
* People come from so many different backgrounds and have many different identities, but in the tech industry in general, and also still in the Python community, the majority of participants are white, financially-secured, young to middle-aged cisgender men.
* When talking about diversity concerns, we’re not talking only about women, but anyone who doesn’t belong to the dominant group, such as people of non-white ethnicity, LGTBQ, people with different physical or mental disabilities, people from different social classes, non-tech people and many more.
* The subject of diversity is present in the Python community in general, but sometimes it feels that it should be present and dominant far more, especially in big events such as EuroPython. it’s not enough to state the interest in a diverse community or to applaud for the things that have already happened in this aspect, we can always put more efforts into having a more open and diverse community.

### Challenges We Face while Promoting Diversity in the Community
* It’s not always simple to find people from diverse backgrounds who would be willing to speak in events, and we’re not always sure how to encourage more diverse people to become speakers. Is it a problem of outreach?
* The possible conflict between providing a safer space for people from different backgrounds to engage in the community versus creating segregation or marginalization.
* The tension between the desire for organic or natural growth and engagement in the community versus proactive attempts. Proactive attempts (such as saving spots for diverse speakers and representation) may feel very needed to some, but may also seem artificial and coerced to others: The desire is for real authentic participation, and for token diverse people.
* There may be a tension between asking people from minority groups for their inputs versus putting people on the spot (i.e."the woman in tech").
* Sometimes interests of different diverse people and minorities may conflict.

### Class Issues
* Economical privilege is an actual privilege and we should be aware of it.
* the cost of events, even if sponsored (such as EuroPython), may be excluding for people from different social classes.
* more volunteers can lower the expenses and the cost for all attendees.
* In addition, if volunteers receive reduced or free tickets, this will: 1) show them gratitude; 2) create their commitment; and 3) enable people to lower their own costs by volunteering.

### Venues
* The physical space influences social relations.
* Early closing of the venue can lead to excluding of certain people from interacting with other participants (the social center moves to pricy bars etc.). Having venues that are open untill late (or all night) can lead to more positive interactions and hacking.
* Venues and venue location can exclude or include people, and so when choosing location for events diversity considerations should be addressed.

### Code of Conduct
* Giving proper floor for presentation of the code of conduct and working group is highly important, and should take place at the beginning of events and different platforms.
* Everyone should be informed of the ways to approach the code of conduct working group and of the way the group functions.
* It is in the community’s interest to support and create community resolutions for violations of code of conduct, and to encourage accountability and responsibility taking.
* Everyone can and should be allies and stand up against harassment and bullying when encountered with such (not just in events but also online and any community interactions).
* Offensive jokes should not be tolerated. We should be aware of proper forums (i.e. a joke that may be acceptable in a local meetup where everybody knows and trust each other may not be appropriate in a large forum such a EuroPython). Private jokes may not be understood as such in a large forum and may be offensive towards others.
* Distribution of responsibilities and power: 1) helps to avoid burnout of those who deal with violations; and 2) makes sure that cases of conflict do not become a popularity contest and are always treated in concrete manner.
* Avoidance of violation of code of conduct is a community issue and interest; it is not just the problem of the code of conduct working group.

### Safer Spaces
* safer spaces for diverse groups such as women and newcomers are important. Women are not the only type of people that may need such spaces, this is the basic code of conduct of simply being nice (or even - not being jerks) towards each other.
* Competition may be an excluding value (especially in a community that aims for sharing).
* Policies such as “first comes first serves”, especially when physical (i.e. signing up for lightning talks, gift distribution etc.) can deter or completely disable certain diverse people from participating.

### More Things to Do and Consider When Working Towards Diversity
* Proactive efforts for creating more diversity are needed.
* Research shows that positive discrimination does not lower the results, but rather raises them.
* In order to become more diverse, we need to be aware and passionate about the topic all the time, examining everything through “diversity glasses”.
* We need to have more involvement of people who are diversity aware at all stages of planning events.
* Encouraging people from diverse and different groups to step up and give their opinion regarding diversity and to take part in the organization of events: actively seeking different voices of different people from different groups from different countries.
* Inform of all steps that are taken to enable diversity (i.e. let it be known that a venue is accessible for people with physical disabilities).
* Targeted outreach towards people from different backgrounds, ages etc.
* Have elaborated checklists for inclusion (i.e. all the steps we need to do to carry out the Code of Conduct/ to have an physically accessible event/ to include people of all ages).
* Food is not something neutral, it is a diversity issue that should be considered (vegan and vegetarians, allergies, religious considerations). Lots of talk about meat and pictures in group chats etc can be excluding and even offensive for vegs.
* Always strive to be more inclusive and to think of practical things to do to become more inclusive, for example:
  * Spaces for children (and maybe even coding tracks!) so that parents can attend events.
  * Live typing during lectures (at least keynotes) to include people with hearing disabilities (and eve language barriers).
  * Quiet spaces (such as quiet room) or tags for people to wear when in need for peace and quiet.
  * Core track (for beginners, but not only).
different locations for ep to be inclusive for sifferent people (i.e. woen eho are traveling alone, accesibility for people from different parts of the continent, costs of travel)
  * A welcoming committee in the airport can assist in creating a safer environment for participants (such as women who are traveling alone, newcomers, young people).
